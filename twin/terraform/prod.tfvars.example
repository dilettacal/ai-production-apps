# Production Considerations:
# - Use a more powerful Bedrock model (nova-pro vs nova-micro)
# - Higher API throttling limits for production traffic
# - Enable custom domain with SSL certificate
# - Consider using AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive values
# - Set up monitoring and alerting
# - Configure backup and disaster recovery
